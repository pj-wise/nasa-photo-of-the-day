Small CRA project made with the Nasa API.
Pick a date (today's or any previous date) and a new photo with info will be rendered.

Incorporates the use of Axios and Material Date Picker as well as Semantic UI modals.

I do plan on adding handling the errors that arise from picking a later date, till then stay in the present or past ðŸ˜‰

additional notes: There is no significance for the inital state of date being January 17th.
